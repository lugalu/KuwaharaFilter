# KuwaharaFilter
Project focused on Implementing the KuwaharaFilter in Swift for iOS

Currently This project is on hold, differently from dithering  kuwahara needs a lot of cycles and memory to be implemented. 
so the package does Work for the CPU variant with B&W and Colored, but in a standard 1920x1080 at 10 size for the kernel is way too much data to be used in a realistic time that the user would wait.

But as soon SPM has full support I plan to make this work and document everything.

## Features

Full CPU support for B&W and colored standard kuwahara.
